The current service criteria are as follows:

Service criteria
Capulet Engine	    Once every 30,000 miles
Willoughby Engine	Once every 60,000 miles
Sternman Engine	    Only when the warning indicator is on
Spindler Battery	Once every 2 years
Nubbin Battery	    Once every 4 years


There are five car models in Lyft’s fleet, each with a different engine-battery combination. These are outlined below:

Car	        Engine	           Battery
Calliope	Capulet Engine	   Spindler Battery
Glissade	Willoughby Engine  Spindler Battery
Palindrome	Sternman Engine	   Spindler Battery
Rorschach	Willoughby Engine  Nubbin Battery
Thovex	    Capulet Engine	   Nubbin Battery



• Service criteria will change somewhat frequently in the future
• New service criteria can be added quickly  
• Making a change to the service criteria for a given car part should only require making a change in one place. 

• New car models are bound to be added to the fleet. 
• Change which parts each car model includes (e.g. change the battery installed on the Thovex from a Nubbin to a Spindler).

• System must also take tires into account when determining if a car should be serviced in the future.


If you are having trouble coming up with a good design, take a look at the following resources:

Once you have an idea of how to organize the system, draft and submit your UML class diagram. The intent of this class diagram is to show an 
improved design, worry less about the proper UML syntax.

When you’re finished, convert your class diagram to a PDF and submit it below.
